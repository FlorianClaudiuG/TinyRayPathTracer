# TinyRayPathTracer

Year 2 University Computer Graphics Assignment. We were asked to build upon a very basic framework and create our own ray and path tracer.

This project consists of two separate projects built on the same framework, the ray tracer that was given to us first and which we had to
properly implement (as what we were given could only produce a blue, empty screen), and the path tracer that was given as a later task to build upon this same framework, but without any code to start from (although we were given examples and explanations).

A standalone .exe file is in the Executable folder.

For the ray tracer, I added some code in the "Scene.cpp" and "RayTracer.cpp" files and their respective headers. The code for the path
tracer is mostly in the "PathTracer.cpp" file and its header.
